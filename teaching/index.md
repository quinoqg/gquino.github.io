# Teaching


Currently teaching Mechanics in the [Department of Aeronautics](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/aeronautics/), Imperial College.
Previously, I have also taught several modules at the [Engineering Science Department](https://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/), [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/). 

## Mechanics Part II
In this  module, students learn the basic fundamentals of dynamics. This module provides a basis for subsequent courses in structural mechanics and dynamics, and flight mechanics which are taught in later years. The subjects covered include particle representation (centres of mass and moments of inertia), energy and momentum methods, vibrations, and basic orbital mechanics. [See module descriptor](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/aeronautics/study/ug/current-students/modules/?module=AERO40007&year=22_23).

## B8 Materials

In this module, students learn about 4 of the most relevant materials in engineering design: metals, ceramics, polymers and composites.

## B5 Solid Mechanics
In this module, students learn elasticity. In particular, I have led the practical demonstration and implemented the section of analysis of strains with digital image correlation analysis, used since 2016.

## Introduction to FEM
In the laboratory session students are given a design problem that they have to solve using the FEA module of SolidWorks.

## P5 Design
In the laboratory session students learn the basics of engineering drawing standards using Solidworks.
