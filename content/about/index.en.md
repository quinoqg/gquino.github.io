I am Gustavo Quino [(CV)](../files/CV-GustavoQuino.pdf), lecturer at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/aeronautics/). Prior to joining Imperial College, I was senior researcher at the [Bristol Composites Institute](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/composites/) and postdoctoral research associate at the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/), where I obtained my PhD degree. My research interests include: mechanical characterisation, polymers, composites, compression of composites, experimental mechanics, impact, digital image correlation, instrumentation, and micromechanical modelling.

I am also a musician!
